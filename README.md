# CMake Modules, files and so on.

This repository contains random files I maintain for my own purposes.  They are made public for the purposes of letting others use them, provide feedback, and so on.

The potential licences for the files are stored in `LICENCE` folder.  The header will state which licence it is released under, the text may be found there.  If no licence is specified in the header then the default assumption is `3-CLAUSE-BSD`.  The reason only a short name is listed in the header is for convenience; again, these are typically moved around my projects.

## Stability

The CMake files are largely taken straight out of my own projects.  There are some modifications (mostly adding comments).  Any breakage is likely in my own use, which probably hints as to how the projects using it employ them.  The examples are similarly taken straight out of my projects, though there may be typos as they are untested.
